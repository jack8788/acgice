## Introduction

Inspired by the secret search, I used PHP to make this project (there is a personal squirting PHP is rubbish, I used PHP to do this and hit his face)

The project front end is referenced to the secret search: https://github.com/entropage/mijisou/ and a series of changes have been optimized.

A lightweight aggregate search multi-language framework.
